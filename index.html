    <p class="text1"><strong style="color: crimson;">Dishonored</strong> is a 2012 action-adventure game developed by
        Arkane Studios and published <br>
        by Bethesda Softworks. Set in the fictional, plague-ridden industrial city of Dunwall, Dishonored
        follows the story of Corvo Attano, bodyguard the Empress of the Isles. He is framed for her
        murder and forced to become an assassin, seeking revenge on those who conspired against him.
        Corvo is aided in his quest by the Loyalists—a resistance group fighting to reclaim Dunwall,
        and the Outsider—a powerful being who imbues Corvo with magical abilities. Several noted actors
        including Susan Sarandon, Brad Dourif, Carrie Fisher, Michael Madsen, John Slattery, Lena Headey
        and Chloë Grace Moretz provided voice work for the game.</p>

    <p class="text2">The game is played from a first-person perspective and allows the player to undertake a series
        of missions in a variety of ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed
        through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and
        alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions,
        eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed
        in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment
        are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.</p>

        class="img2">
    <p class="text3">During its three years in production, several versions of <strong style="color: red;">Dishonored
        </strong>were developed.
        Before the creation of⠀Dunwall—inspired by late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh—the game
        was set to take place in medieval⠀Japan and seventeenth-century London. During development, test
        players discovered methods of exploiting the⠀available powers and abilities to achieve unexpected
        outcomes; instead of restricting these techniques, the designers⠀attempted to redesign levels to
        accommodate them. <strong style="color: red;">Dishonored's</strong> music score was produced by composer Daniel
        Licht to represent
        London in the nineteenth century.</p>

    <p class="text4">Dishonored received positive reviews, focusing on the missions' individual narratives
        and the freedom available in⠀completing them. Criticism fell on the overarching narrative, which
        was considered predictable, and problems in⠀controlling the player's character. The game won several
        awards, including the 2012 Spike Video Game award for Best Action-Adventure Game and the 2013 BAFTA
        award for Best Game, and was repeatedly recognized as the best action-adventure game of 2012 and one
        of that year's best games. Dishonored was initially released in October 2012,⠀for Microsoft Windows,
        PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and was later supplemented with additional content focusing⠀on the
        assassin Daud and his quest for redemption. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were
        released⠀in August 2015.</p>

    <p class="gptext1"><strong style="color: red;">Dishonored</strong> is an action-adventure game played from a
        first-person perspective with an
        emphasis on stealth action and the use of gadgets and the environment to eliminate opposing forces.
        The game world is a series of self-contained, mission-focused areas designed for multiple avenues
        of exploration in terms of in-game movement and powers. Between missions, the player is taken
        to a central hub called the Hound Pits pub where the player character Corvo can meet with his
        allies, receive mission briefings and alternate objectives, and convert recovered loot into new
        equipment and upgrades. In-game areas include loading docks, royal estates, poverty-stricken
        streets, and a bathhouse. The player can save their progress anywhere, and the game includes a
        checkpoint save system. Saving is disabled during combat. The game has four difficulty levels
        which modify the effectiveness of health and mana (magic) potions, and enemies' awareness, damage
        delivered, and responsiveness. In the easy setting, health regeneration is possible.</p>

    <p class="gptext2"><strong style="color: red;">Dishonored</strong> features role-playing game elements, such as the
        ability to
        upgrade powers and to make moral choices with a focus on non-linear consequences.
        The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non-player
        characters (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal
        situation given by co-creative designer Harvey Smith involved the player completing a side
        mission for a character, and in return that character had two of Corvo's targets kidnapped
        and enslaved. Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets.
        Movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support the player character's
        abilities, rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style,
        such as hacking or sneaking. Specific elements of missions, such as changes to
        the color of a target's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized, requiring
        the player to explore the game area to find the target each time the mission is played.</p>

    <p class="gptext3">The player's actions are not judged to be good or evil, but instead
        are tracked by a "chaos" system that records the amounts of friendly fire, violence,
        and deaths the player causes. This modifies the game world, affecting the story without
        directly punishing the player or forcing them to choose one style of play over another.
        For example, an NPC who disapproves of violence may refuse to support the
        player, or may even betray them. The game reacts to the chaos caused in scripted ways,
        such as changing dialogue, and dynamic ways, such as increasing the presence of rats and
        plagued citizens and adding new scenes. This can affect the active mission and future
        missions. The system also influences which of the game's two endings is reached, with
        variations based on which characters live or die. Using violence allows missions to be
        completed in less time than using a stealth approach, but violence consumes more in-game
        resources such as health and mana potions, which are required more often in direct combat.</p>

    <p class="gptext4"><strong style="color: red;">Dishonored</strong> features six active powers, four passive powers
        or enhancements,
        and forty bone charms which grant the player supernatural perks, such as the ability to increase
        the duration of rat possession. Initially, only three bone charms can be active at any
        time; up to six can be active through optional upgrades. Smith and designer Raphaël
        Colantonio stated that it is impossible for a player to accrue all of the powers and abilities
        in a single playthrough. The player requires mana to use these abilities; mana partially
        regenerates after use to allow "Blink" and "Dark Vision" powers to be used, but mana potions
        are required to regenerate more mana, restricting the use of higher cost abilities like
        "Possession" and "Bend Time." Magic and ranged weapons are assigned to the player
        character's left hand control and a sword is assigned to the right hand control:</p>

        class="gpimg1">

    <p class="gptext5">The main supernatural powers are unlocked and purchased using runes—artifacts
        carved from whale bone—and each can be upgraded. Powers include "Dark Vision", which
        allows the player to see enemies through walls, their field of view and highlights interactive
        objects; "Blink", a short-distance teleportation ability; "Possession", that allows
        the player to temporarily inhabit and possess other characters; "Devouring Swarm", which
        summons a swarm of deadly rats; "Bend Time", that slows or freezes time; "Wind Blast",
        a gust of wind that can knock down enemies; and "Shadow Kill" that turns dead enemies
        to ash, preventing their discovery by opposing forces. The player can use weapons
        including a sword, grenades, a crossbow, and pistols. Coins must be collected to
        upgrade weapons and gadgets:</p>

        height="350" align="right" class="gpimg3">
    <br>
    <p class="gptext6">Stealth is based on limiting the player character's visibility; hiding
        behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding
        lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player
        can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, and as long as
        Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look
        through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind
        enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead
        bodies can be moved and hidden. <br><br>Guards have several states of alertness,
        ranging from normal to suspicious; they can become aware of the player's
        presence or can actively search for them. Enemy artificial intelligence
        (AI) will respond to sound and can be distracted using sound to lure guards
        away from their positions. If the player remains concealed from guards,
        their alertness will drop to "aware", but it will not return to normal in
        that mission. Enemies communicate their states of alertness to their allies,
        increasing the alertness level throughout the mission.</p>

        class="syimg1">
    <p class="sytext1"><strong style="color: red;">Dishonored</strong> takes place in the industrial city of Dunwall,
        where technology and otherworldly forces coexist. The city's design
        is modeled on London and Edinburgh between the late 1800s and the early
        1900s. The capital of the Empire of the Isles, Dunwall is
        ruled by an oppressive regime that came to power following the
        assassination of the Empress and the kidnapping of her daughter.
        The city is a center for fishing and whaling; whale oil
        is a valuable resource which is needed to power the city. After
        a philosopher discovered that whale oil—known in the city as
        trans—can be used as a fuel, the government used it to develop
        powerful weaponry, which in turn bred government corruption.
        The city is stricken with a plague spread by rats, which
        is killing the poor and isolating the rich. The infected,
        known as "weepers", cry blood and can become violent.
        The government uses the plague as an excuse to take or purge
        citizens as they wish. Order is maintained by the Tallboys,
        heavily armored officers on tall, mechanical legs, and districts
        are separated by barriers known as "Walls of Light", which are
        made of energy and disintegrate unauthorized people who try
        to cross them. A covert group of activists, the Loyalists,
        plots to overthrow the government and install the Empress'
        daughter as the new Empress.</p>

    <p class="sytext2">The main character of Dishonored, whom the player
        controls, is Corvo Attano, the former bodyguard to Dunwall's Empress
        Jessamine Kaldwin (April Stewart). Corvo becomes an infamous
        assassin after he is framed for the empress' murder. He is skilled
        in stealth and combat, is armed with unusual gadgets, and possesses
        great supernatural powers. The game designers chose Corvo
        to remain silent so that players could project themselves onto the
        character. Corvo is aided by the Loyalists, led by Admiral
        Farley Havelock (John Slattery), and members: Piero Joplin
        (Brad Dourif)—an inventor who builds Corvo's mask and supplies
        him with gadgets; Treavor Pendleton (Derek Phillips)—a member
        of parliament; Samuel (Ryan Cutrona)—a commoner who ferries
        Corvo to and from his missions; Overseer Teague Martin
        (Joel Johnstone); and Callista Curnow (Lena Headey)—the
        caretaker for the Empress' daughter Young Lady Emily
        (Chloë Grace Moretz). Other characters include Granny
        Rags (Susan Sarandon)—a former aristocrat now blind
        and deranged after years of living on the streets;
        Daud (Michael Madsen)—leader of a group of
        assassins known as "the Whalers"; and Slackjaw (Al Rodrigo)—a gang
        leader. Carrie Fisher and Gregg Berger
        provide the voices of the loudspeakers found
        throughout the city relaying government propaganda.

        The Outsider (Billy Lush) offers to help Corvo
        in his quest. Described as a mixture of God and the Devil, The
        Outsider imprints his mark on Corvo, imbuing him with magical abilities, and provides him with a
        mechanically altered human heart (April Stewart) that tells Corvo secrets. The Outsider also grants his
        mark, and special abilities, to other characters.Smith described the character as an amoral figure who
        grants abilities, but leaves the choice of how to use them up to the recipient.

        Corvo's targets include the Lord Regent Hiram Burrows (Kristoffer Tabori)—the Empress' former spymaster who
        masterminded her death and framed Corvo, and now controls Dunwall; Burrows' lover Lady Boyle (Anna
        Graves)—an aristocrat funding the military; Lords Custis and Morgan known as the Pendleton Twins
        (Zach Hanks)—members of parliament; High Overseer Thaddeus Campbell (Daniel Hagen)—leader of the city's
        religious order; and Anton Sokolov (Roger Jackson)—a genius inventor responsible for the creation of many
        advanced technologies including the Wall of Light.</p>

    <h2 class="plot" id="syplot">Plot</h2>
    <img src="https://gamebomb.ru/files/galleries/001/f/f9/60670.jpg" height="400px" align="left" class="plotimg">
    <p class="sytext3">After returning from a foreign voyage to seek aid with the deadly plague ravaging the city, Corvo
        Attano travels to the tower of Dunwall and meets with the Empress. After delivering a message, they are attacked
        by teleporting assassins led by Daud; they magically restrain Corvo, kill the Empress, and kidnap her daughter
        Emily. The Empress' Spymaster arrives and has Corvo imprisoned for her murder and Emily's abduction. Six
        months later, the Spymaster has seized control of Dunwall as Lord Regent. Interrogating Corvo, the Lord Regent
        confesses that he masterminded the assassination and framed Corvo. The following day, Corvo is due to be
        executed. A letter from Empire Loyalists is smuggled to Corvo and he is given the means to escape. Samuel
        ferries Corvo to the Hound Pits Pub to meet the Loyalists, led by Admiral Havelock. <br>

        While resting, Corvo is taken to a dream world where he meets the Outsider, who brands Corvo with his mark.
        Corvo is sent by the Loyalists to eliminate the conspirators behind the Lord Regent's plot, and the player is
        given the option to kill or otherwise neutralize the targets, the first of which is High Overseer Campbell.
        Corvo removes the High Overseer and discovers that Emily is being held in a brothel called the Golden Cat under
        the supervision of twins Custis and Morgan Pendleton. Corvo rescues Emily and eliminates the brothers.
        After returning to the pub, Emily is taken into the care of Callista to prepare her for becoming Empress, while
        Corvo is sent to abduct the genius scientist Sokolov, who is responsible for the Lord Regent's powerful
        technologies. Sokolov is taken to the pub for interrogation, under which he divulges the identity of the Lord
        Regent's financier, Lady Boyle. Corvo infiltrates Boyle's masquerade ball and disposes of her.

        After returning to the pub, Havelock confirms they have done enough damage to move against the Lord Regent.
        Corvo infiltrates the tower of Dunwall and removes the Lord Regent from power. He learns that the Lord Regent
        intentionally imported the plague to decimate the lower classes of society, but it escalated out of his
        control. Corvo returns to the Hound Pits Pub, where the Loyalists celebrate their success. After sharing a
        drink, Corvo goes to his room and collapses. Upon waking, he learns that Samuel poisoned his drink at the behest
        of Havelock and his Loyalist allies Treavor Pendleton and Teague Martin, to prevent him from interfering in
        their plan to install Emily as Empress and rule through her. Samuel remained loyal to Corvo and had given him a
        non-lethal dose of poison. Samuel sets Corvo adrift on the river and flees. When Corvo wakes, he is taken
        prisoner by Daud and his men, who intend to claim the bounty placed on Corvo's head by the now Lord Regent
        Havelock. <br>

        Corvo defeats Daud and his assassins before going into the sewers. Corvo returns to the pub to find it
        overrun with guards and that Havelock has killed many of the Loyalists. He discovers where Havelock has taken
        Emily and can save Piero, Sokolov, and Callista. Corvo signals to Samuel, who ferries him to the former Lord
        Regent's lighthouse. He infiltrates the lighthouse and either subdues Pendleton and Martin or finds that
        Havelock has already killed them, ensuring the Loyalists' actions remain secret. Once finished with
        Havelock, Corvo may or may not rescue Emily. Havelock's journal reveals that he suspected that Emily is Corvo's
        daughter. <br>

        The ending varies depending upon the level of chaos the player has caused throughout the game. If Corvo saves
        Emily, she ascends the throne as Empress with Corvo at her side. If a small amount of chaos has been caused, a
        golden age dawns and the plague is overcome. After many decades, Corvo dies of natural causes, and Empress Emily
        Kaldwin I the Wise buries him beside Empress Jessamine. If much chaos is caused, the city remains in turmoil
        and is overrun with the plague. If Corvo fails to save Emily, Dunwall crumbles, and Corvo flees the city by
        ship.</p>

    <h2 class="plot" id="design">DESIGN</h2>

    <p class="sytext3">Dishonored was originally set in medieval Japan, but the idea was dropped early in the game's
        development because of the difficulties presented in marketing the setting, and because no member of the design
        team knew much about the culture. Arkane moved the setting to London in 1666, considering that the city was
        recognizable to Europeans and Americans. Later designs inspired by added gameplay mechanics such as floodlights,
        electrified barriers and 20th-century technologies that it no longer resembled London, and Arkane opted to
        develop a fictional city. The city of Dunwall, designed to be a "contemporary and cool" "period piece",
        was inspired by late-19th and early-20th-century London and Edinburgh. Describing why London had been an
        initial setting and remained a significant inspiration, Smith said:
        <br><br>
        Because it was the last year of the plague, and the year of the great fire of London, which of course ended the
        plague by burning the slums down ... In this kind of game you’re always looking for a way to up the tension and
        frankly make the world a little more perilous, and justify why there aren’t giant crowds of people at the
        market. Then people had the idea for swarms of rats, and we were talking independently about possession, and we
        wondered if you should be able to possess rats and if they could clean up corpses so you don’t have to hide
        them. All these pieces just worked together.
        <br><br>
        Antonov described his inspiration from London as "a big metropolis, it's messy, it's chaotic and intense ... and
        it's both exotic and familiar to Americans and to Europeans." He highlighted the importance of that familiarity
        to different cultures because "you want to communicate to a lot of people when you make a new piece of fiction."
        He said that Edinburgh provided a sense of containment and a variety of architectural designs, which were
        combined with a futuristic vision which Antonov said was not comparable to the brass, rivets, and steam of
        steampunk design. Antonov and Mitton traveled to London and Edinburgh for research, taking photographs of
        people, places, and objects. The pair avoided the busier streets and focused on side streets and alleyways that
        would better suit the game's world. Mitton stated: "We were trying to design the game from a rat's viewpoint ...
        if we have a small city, from a constrained viewpoint, what are all the different angles that we can
        explore?" Inspiration also came from the artwork of John Atkinson Grimshaw, Canaletto, and Gustave Doré.
        The world map was designed as a single piece of art and was sectioned so the designers were clear on where each
        mission takes place.
        <br><br>
        In-game characters were inspired by illustrations from adventure and pirate stories such as Captain Blood
        (1922), the work of Charles Dana Gibson, and mugshots from Edwardian London and Australia. An
        anatomy expert helped ensure the morphology of character faces represented Great Britain, while Arkane
        maintained a sense of realism and political incorrectness. Mitton established defining groups for
        characters such as rich, poor, and hostile with specific anatomy and posture designs, and animators created
        stylized movements for each social class and specific characters to help convey emotions. The city guards, for
        example, have small heads, low shoulders, and big hands, with animations that blend human and monkey
        movements. Antonov and Mitton employed a textile carpet designer in Russia to design and paint some of the
        in-game art.
        <br><br>
        The designers conceived the Tallboys as town criers. Stilts were later added after Mitton noticed someone
        cleaning their office façade while wearing stilts; the town crier role was replaced with loudspeakers throughout
        Dunwall. The Tallboy design evolved into a lamplighter that would light street lamps with whale oil tanks,
        but after further development, the designers considered that their tall, mechanical legs allowed them to burn
        the dead and deal with plague-infected citizens while remaining above them and avoiding infection, leading to
        their final design as a guard armed with a bow. Mitton suggested adding a phosphorus canister to the
        Tallboys' backs for aesthetic reasons, but Smith suggested whale oil, which in turn led Mitton to design the
        whaling ships to give the whales a visible presence in the city. For other technologies, designers
        conceptualized using 18th-century technology to build modern items and vehicles, and creating 18th-century items
        using modern tools.
        <br><br>
        The Heart is a human heart modified with technology and the supernatural, that helps the player to find
        collectible items in the levels, and "plays a part related to informing [the player's] decisions about when to
        apply violence or not, making it a really interesting, more subtle part of the power fantasy." The Heart
        provides contextual verbal feedback to the player, offering insight into a particular location, the secrets or
        history of a character, and its own origins. The Heart was originally designed as a method of identifying
        assassination targets using vibration and sound mechanics. The design then developed into the concept of the
        Heart speaking and feeling alive and having its own agenda. As a result of player-conducted testing of the game,
        the designers decided that a more direct navigation system was required. The Heart's gameplay role continued to
        change, and it continued to provide narration on its perceptions of different characters, which helped to
        reinforce the narrative themes and to differentiate the city's social classes in a more subtle alternative to
        having the characters provide expository dialogue. Colantonio and Smith were concerned that optional use of the
        Heart would result in some players missing the information it provides, but they considered that it was a part
        of giving the player the freedom to choose how to play.
        <br><br>
        The Hound Pits pub, which acts as a base for the player, was initially a larger structure. Filling out the
        interior of the pub required too many stairs and rooms, and the large amount of climbing made navigation
        confusing. The team found retaining the large exterior they wanted while creating and disguising a smaller
        interior that was easier to traverse challenging. The pub's exterior was shrunk to resemble an Edwardian
        building, but the interior remained labyrinthine so Colantonio required that a chain be placed outside Corvo's
        bedroom, allowing him to reach the roof quickly. In frustration, the designers decided to simply close off the
        third floor entirely. The art team continued to receive requests throughout development, requiring them to
        extend pre-production until the end of the development cycle. Each design was hand drawn.</p>
